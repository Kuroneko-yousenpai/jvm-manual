go to the <a href="https://github.com/WalmartSolutions/jvm-manual/wiki">wiki</a> for material.

# Disclaimer
This wiki is still not *finished* and won't be for a pretty long time which means you might see missing information or incorrect information, refer to the issues page for this.

# Contributions
Contributions are completely welcome although there are a few requirements.
### Grammar
- You don't need to be an English major, occasional mistakes are fine but try not to make them.
- Having good grammar makes the information on the wiki more clear and understandable.
### Page length
-  A long page may overwhelm or bore the reader and prevent them from fully reading the information provided, to circumvent this you shouldn't make pages that are very long.
- Long pages are fine but try not to make it too long, use the existing pages for reference.
### Topics
- Avoid talking too much about topics that have already been **only extensively** covered, this is kind of redundant but I feel it should be mentioned.
### Ethics
- Should be common sense but try not to make this a 'how to crack software!!' type of guide, this wiki is for reverse engineering. 
- This doesn't mean you are limited to the amount of information you are allowed to give but simply means that you shouldn't make a step-by-step guide on how to crack software.

There are obviously more but you should use common sense for those ones.
